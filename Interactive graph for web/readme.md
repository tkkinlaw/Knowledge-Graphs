### Interactive graph hosted in an ArcGIS StoryMap

I want to embed a web page that provides an interactive graph.
Currently, I can use the ArgoLite tool to publish an experience and embed it into the story. But I don't have control over this published experience. Maybe I can host it on my GitHub instead of the default?

Or, can I use JavaScript to publish a custom experience?
